    "Sequential forward floating selection is a __variation of sequential forward selection__. It __starts with zero features__ and adds one feature at a time, just like sequential forward selection, __but after each addition, it checks to see if we can improve performance by _removing_ a feature__.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If performance can’t be improved, the floating algorithm will continue to the next step and add another feature.\n",
    "- If performance can be improved, the algorithm will make the removal that improves performance the most (unless removal of that feature would lead to an infinite loop of adding and removing the same feature over and over again).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let’s say that the algorithm has just added weight to the feature set {age, resting_heart_rate}, resulting in the set {age, weight, resting_heart_rate}. The floating algorithm will test whether it can improve performance by removing age or resting_heart_rate. If the removal of age improves performance, then the algorithm will proceed with the set {weight, resting_heart_rate}."
